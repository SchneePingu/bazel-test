C++ library configured with CMake\Make
--------------------------------------

To configure and build the project, run the following commands:

> mkdir -p build

> cd build

> cmake ..

> make


HINT:
Calling cmake from a temporary build folder, e.g. 'build', is advantageous
for cleaning the project folder from temporary build files.
